    "# 2018 Oscars Predictions: How BigML got 6 for 6!\n",

    "## Looking for the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning bases its predictions in data of the past, so we had to obtain all the information we could about the history of the Oscars nominees and winners for each analyzed category. The first place that comes to mind is IMDB, where anyone can find all the relevant information about movies these days. We expected to be able to get that data by using an API access. There are several APIs, like the [Open Movies Database](http://imdbapi.net/), that allow you to search movies by title or year and return basic information: title, rating, genre, etc."

When trying to predict each award, we selected we selected the objective field as the one that stored the information about the winners of that award, i.e. the `Oscar_best_picture_won` was selected as objective field when trying to predict the winner of the best picture award.

By using it, we tried to ensure that the right topology was used so that we obtained a top performing classifier. A `Deepnet` was built for each award category by configuring the objective field as the one storing the award winners' information. We'll take as an example the **Best Picture Award**.
